    <h1>What is the difference between var and let?</h1>
    <p>var declares a variable similar to let, however, it has no block scope 
        and declarations are processed at the function start meaning that variables are defined from the beginning of the function
        while let cannot be redeclared and it has block scope, which means that the variable is only accessible within the curly braces in which it is declared. </p>

    <h1>What is the difference between var and const?</h1>
    <p>var are function scoped or global scoped that can be hoisted(raised to the top of the function) 
        while const are blocked scoped variables that are constant and cannot be reassigned once it has been assigned. </p>

    <h1>What is the difference between let and const?</h1>
    <p>Both let and var are blocked scoped, howere, let can be reassigned but not redeclared while const cannot be reassigned or redeclared.</p>
   
    <h1>What is hoisting?</h1>
    <p>hoisting allows you to use functions and variables before they are declared. </p>
